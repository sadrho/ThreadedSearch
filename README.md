# ThreadedSearch
A java search program...
It's suppose to search for a given string moving through a given directory. 
Currently I'm having issues with the program hanging with the search thread.
From what I understand the CopyThread is clearing the copyList before the search thread is done searching.
I'll give it another look later... maybe tonight.(12/1/23)
Feel free to chime in.
